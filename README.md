Anyone wants to try the most advanced CSM? That's Coherent Speech Models.  
Very interesting actually. But if I had to describe this in easier terms, I would say a TTS that can understand the way humans speak, like the emotions behind words.  
And, well, **`it just translates your text words into voice with emotions.`** 

That is, that is all.  

I have just given you a Colab notebook. Well, a file and the link. So you can just choose anyone you like and just play around. It's very interesting, to be honest. Go ahead. I have tried something.
