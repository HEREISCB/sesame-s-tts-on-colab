# Sesame-S-TTS on Colab  

Anyone wants to try the most advanced **CSM**? *(That's Coherent Speech Models.)*  
Very interesting actually. But if I had to describe this in simpler terms, I would say:  

A **TTS that understands how humans speak**, capturing the emotions behind words.  
And, well,  

> **`it just translates your text words into voice with emotions.`**  

That is, that is all.  

I have provided a **Colab notebook**, along with a file and the link.  
So, you can choose any option and just play around.  

It's very interesting, to be honest. **Go ahead! Iâ€™ve tried something.** ðŸš€
